## To-do
- [x] Laying foundation to our concepts and code
- [x] Model builing
- [x] Documentation
- [ ] Running the models locally as web apps
- [ ] Deploying to cloud
- [ ] Writing REST API's to our apps and maybe GRAPHQL API's
- [ ] Blog writing


## Built With

* [Word2Vec](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html) - Backbone technology
* [BBC dataset](http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html) - Building our first model for demo
* [swwiki](http://kevindonnelly.org.uk/swahili/swwiki/) - Dataset for building swahili model
* [Reddit](http://kevindonnelly.org.uk/swahili/swwiki/) - Used to get chatbot data from scraping
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) - Used for coding
