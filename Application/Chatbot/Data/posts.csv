2,How can I tell my mom I want to visit a psychologist as indirectly as possible?,31,"This last month I feel absolutely terrible. I can not sleep at night because I get bombarded with thoughts. I used to speak somewhat fast but now I speak like I am about to rap battle eminem. And I get some REALLY vivid dreams of my dad who passed away 6 years ago that make me feel terrible. I would love to visit a psychologist because he might help me. But it's weird to talk to my mom about it. 

(I am 15, male idk whether that's important)","It is a tough thing to ask for no matter your age but it is good that you want to do something.

Are you still in school by chance? Talking to your school counselor could be a helpful way to go about it. They can help you speak to you mom about it and provide some recommendations on who to see.

Your school might even have a therapist on staff you could talk to, the school I work at has three."
3,I feel like I'm losing my ability to express myself,85,"I am bilingual. I speak Turkish and English. Also French but only b1 level. Anyways, since I went to the Netherlands in 2017 for my master's degree and consequently started to talk in English more frequently, I feel like I have lost my ability to speak properly in both languages. I've been back to Turkey for a year now but when I talk to people I stutter, use the wrong words and try to speak too quickly that no one understands. It feels like my tongue can't keep up with my mind. or sometimes I get excited/nervous and screw up. This goes for both languages.

I've been unemployed for a year now and my boyfriend of 4 years broke up with me a few months ago. I've also been suffering from Generalized Anxiety Disorder for a few years now. Can this be because my brain doesn't work properly because I'm depressed or something? 

I'm not even sure if my question has an answer..","I speak 3.5 languages and I can vouch for the fact that a language can be lost over time if you don't practice it. If you communicate in English most of the time and don't use your other languages, you will find it harder to use them. But don't worry, they are still buried in your head and just need a bit of recall and reinforcement and you should be able to get back almost all, if not all, of your former ability."
4,I can't stress this enough.,22,"Exercising not only helps you physically but ALSO MENTALLY! I suffer from major depression and last week, I thought that was the end of it. I pushed myself to get back in the gym and the science is right! It releases endorphin that make us feel better! Although I am sore, I feel so much better mentally! I encourage anyone who is in mental pain to push yourself to try something new, challenge yourself everyday, make plans to look forward to, create positive memories, etc! We can do this! It's not easy but I was desperate to not feel how I was last week.","If you don’t have the energy to do full exercise, just go walk for half an hour. 

Literally walking is enough to get endorphins going to help rinse the shit out."
5,I don't like music anymore and it's making me terribly depressed,8,"I used to love music. I was that kid who would always wear their headphones on when going out. I would listen to the music on my way to school, then I couldn't wait to get out and go home and listen to some more music. I was this awkward girl who had no friends and was too shy to socialize, so basically all I loved during my childhood and teenage years was music. It was my only way of expressing emotion because I couldn't vent to my abusive parents and I didn't have a single friend on this earth, let alone a partner. It was just me and the music, and I loved music more than anything because it was all I ever had. Growing up in a toxic environment, in an abusive family and being mentally ill made me look for an escape, and my escape was music. 


But during the past 2-3 years, my love for music has been gradually disappearing. I have no idea what's causing this. Might be the fact that I'm not a teenager anymore and the struggles of everyday life are taking a toll on me and my personality. My life consists of basically working, eating and sleeping. I work 15 hours a day but I have 2 days off inbetween (you work one day then you stay at home for 2 days then you work another day with 2 other days off and so on) but I still have lots of spare time, it's just that I don't really know how to spend it anymore because nothing really makes me feel good anymore. I can still somewhat force myself to engage in other activities even if they give me little to no emotional reward but my lack of passion for music is the worst. It's almost as if I'm repulsed by it, because it makes me feel nothing now. I try to avoid listening or even interacting with songs and bands that I used to love a lot because my lack of passion for those things that I used to love so dearly makes me extremely depressed so I try to find as much new stuff as I can. I tried looking for new bands and genres to listen to, things that I haven't tried before, but it doesn't work. No matter how much I switch between genres, bands and songs, nothing sparks my interest. No day goes by when I don't mourn this loss. No day goes by when I don't think about not loving music anymore. My life feels empty and pointless without music and I don't know what to do about it because forcing myself to enjoy it makes me feel bitter and resentful and it doesn't work. 

&nbsp;

I just wish I could enjoy music again. Any music, anything, be it old stuff that I used to enjoy or maybe something new and exciting. But nothing makes me feel anything anymore. Music is dead to me and so is my interest in finding new music, and there's nothing I can do about it. As I said, ""fake it till you make it"" doesn't work. I know others have more serious issues and I'm sorry if I sound dumb or ignorant, this is not my intention at all. But music has been something so big in my life that losing my passion for it means losing everything. When you cling to something and you lose that something, it makes you feel defeated because it was all you had, and it leaves you with nothing. I wish there was something I could do about it but there isn't anything. Has anyone ever been through anything like this before? Does it EVER get any better?","I can relate. Music was also how I expressed myself as an anxious person without any real talents. I think music saved my life more than once. But a similar thing happened to me last year, I lost my passion for it. It was the result of a big life crisis (losing my partner). I realized that my love of music had diminished a lot after it, and that, when I tried to listen to what I thought I'd like the most, it just made me feel more depressed. (One, because I didn't like it as much as I used to and had been overconsuming music for years, and two, because the music itself was usually depressing.)

The depression worsened so what I did is I took a break from music to ""dig deep"". I started reading more instead, watching serious films and documentaries, and doing Vipassana meditation. It's recommended to avoid music and other form of entertainment during those retreats (or leading up to them). The meditation experience was very rewarding. For a while I just stopped wishing things were any different and got to know what it's like to just embrace the present moment and gradually let go of wants and expectations. I think a lot of the pain you might be experiencing exists in that resistance to what is, in the melancholia of what once was.

If you can just accept that this is what you're feeling now, you might find that it's not so disturbing. What's disturbing is likely the emptiness that it reveals. If your life boils down to the same repetitive, unfulfilling things day after day, it's normal that it would sap out your joy of living and your experiencing of art. This kind of anhedonia is rarely a permanent condition, because people rarely accept to keep living in a way that makes them feel this way.

 Things are always changing, and whether they change positively or negatively is rarely ever much under our control. Giving up this need for control and letting things pass without much resistance is how they can become better, I believe. After months of not listening to music at all, I can now enjoy it again. In fact I had some very strong feelings listening to King Crimson last month, and I've picked up my guitar again."
6,My grandfather is racist and I have a mixed child,133,So my daughter is half Puerto Rican. My grandpa growls at her and refuses to let her call him grandpa. He glares at her to scare her and it makes me sad for her because I got to call him grandpa and joke with him as a kid but my daughter will never get that experience all because of her race. My grandma LOVES her and gets mad when he acts like this toward her. The first thing I’ve seen first hand of racism and it begins because my daughter isn’t white..,I wouldn’t let him around her under any circumstances. He sounds like a disgusting person and no child deserves to be growled at. The only person that’s gonna hurt by him being around is your daughter.
7,Would you call this morally wrong or a public convenience?,2,"To use a basis for what I’m about to explain, back in the day, in most places, places where people came to eat were separated between smokers and non-smokers. Then the law became more strict and banned smoking in public. So starting when I was little, I noticed my dad was a huge people person, but that those who he talked to didn’t really care. An idea came to me based on something I saw. What if certain places had an introvert section and an extrovert section. Introverts wouldn’t have to breathe in people’s words while extroverts could feel confident that those around them wouldn’t be bothered by the fumes of small talk. But my dad, who I run my ideas by, said “that’s immoral, people shouldn’t be separated just because they interact differently”. How about you?","This doesn't sort itself within restaurants, it sorts it between different restaurants. If you want quiet pizza, you go to one place. If you want to be surrounded by screaming kids, you go to another. There are raucous bars and quiet bars, etc."
8,I have a dentist appointment tomorrow after 7 years and I am very nervous. Please tell me about a time where you was scared of the dentist but it turned out better than expected.,10,"I have an anxiety disorder, GAD, to be specific. I will worry about things from the moment I wake up until I fall asleep. For the past 6 months I've been more worried about my health then anything else. I've gotten to a point where Im afraid to make appointments with doctors, dentists, etc because I'm afraid of receiving bad news. I know that may sound ridiculous to most, but you don't know how terrifying it feels in my mind. 

Anyway- I'm trying not to worry too much about my appointment tomorrow being as its really just a consultation to meet a new dentist and hygienist. Im hoping they will walk my through and explain what I can expect from future appointments. I wanted to have a consultation beforehand to try to lessen my worries and feel more optimistic before my actual exam. Like I said, its been a few years since I've been to the dentist so I'm afraid. I take care of my teeth but I know they need work. 

I'd like to hear your experience when you feared a dental appointment but it turned out ok. It'd be nice to hear from a fellow hypochondriac with a similar experience, but I'll take all the reassurance I can get at this point.","I was in your position a few years ago, to the extent that I was uncontrollably sobbing on the way to my appointment as well as during it. The dentist and hygienist were totally understanding of my fears though. My dentist offered to explain everything to me beforehand so I would know what to expect. I think they deal with nervous patients so often, so they're used to it. Anyway, best of luck! I know it's absolutely terrifying, but you can get through it."
9,I don’t understand this trend of people forcing their personal health views onto other people.,0,"A few quick examples: 1. A guy’s energy drinks were thrown away—by his roommate—so that he’d make healthier choices. 2. On the TV show Shark Tank, one guy wouldn’t invest in a product—cookie dough—because it was unhealthy. 3. The word “obese” is almost considered a judgement now, rather than just a description. 

Why are other people’s diet and exercise choices such an enormous concern to some people? Caring about a person is understandable, and advice is fine. But there’s this trend right now, in America, to be unusually harsh toward unhealthy choices. I don’t understand this vehemence in a country so dedicated to freedom.","I don't know that there are enough things in alignment to call that a trend.  Converse to your point is the ongoing ""body positivity"" movement attempting to normalize obesity.  All sorts of unhealthy behavior is endorsed as normal now."
10,How Do I Carry On After Multiple Sexual Assaults and PTSD?,1,"I'm looking for some coping mechanism or something to help me get by? I'm already on 100mg sertraline, I've been to therapy for PTSD and I have a counsellor appointment this Thursday 

My introduction to kissing was 2 boys that used to bully me, that ended with one of them getting their penis out and I ran away. I think I was around 12

My second experience (?) I had a group of guy frjends, we were best mates but it was constantly a matter of being passed around between the both of them, being touched up etc. (Age 13/14)

I must admit I don't class the above as sexual assaults whatsoever I fully consented I was just immature and naive. 

My first sexual experience I was took advantage of, we lived in a country where clubbing underage was pretty commonplace and most 15/16  year olds would go out. I was in a group of friends but eventually lost them, two lovely lads carried me home as I was insanely drunk and dropped me off with my group of friends. That night one of the boys from the group snook into bed with me, I was so drunk I didn't know what was happening and ended up giving him oral sex before passing out. Later that week I found out he had filmed it without my consent and shared it among mutual friends. 

Between this and the two pivotal sexual assaults that I attribute my PTSD too I had some relationships but they were unusually unhealthy and a lot of the time I was just a past time for boys. I rarely reached girlfriend status and when I did it didn't last.

The first one age 17 I was visiting a friend in Spain, once again underage drinking wasn't particularly frowned upon and we hit up a bar, a guy started flirting with me - I tried to get away to the bathroom but he followed me and forced me to give him oral sex.

The second I was 18, I had met a guy at a party and he looked after me alongside some friends, he seemed really nice and I went to visit him. We hung out with his friends and it seemed sweet. Unfortunately I left my phone back at his house and had to get it. I kept asking when the bus was and he lied and said they came far later than they did so I was forced to stay there. I saw the relationship as totally platonic but he propositioned me, I kept saying no, making up excuses but after two hours of constant begging me to have sex he said ""I don't want to force you but.."" by this point I'd missed the bus and my family was too poor to pay for a taxi. As soon as he said ""I don't want to force you but.."" I knew I had to do it I didn't want to be another statistic if I consented it was okay (Plot twist: I got PTSD regardless) 

I'm 21 years old now and I can't move past it. I can distract flashbacks I can ground myself but it always comes up. I can't have healthy relationships because I end up crying a lot more than one should. I feel like all my experiences have lead me to be this broken shell of a woman, I can't even have sex without feeling like damaged goods.

Can anyone offer some help/insight? Maybe you've been through something similar. I'm looking forward to my counselling appointment but I've not had great experiences with my countries national health service as it's chronically underfunded.","I don't know that there are enough things in alignment to call that a trend.  Converse to your point is the ongoing ""body positivity"" movement attempting to normalize obesity.  All sorts of unhealthy behavior is endorsed as normal now."
11,My cat saved my life today,531,"Trigger warning: suicide

Today I was in tears and closed my bedroom door and started tying a hangman’s Knot. All of a sudden my cat stuck his paw under my door and grabbed the rope, pulled it all under and ran away with it. I know he was just trying to play but he made me stop and think about everything I have. He changed my mind. I know it’s cliche but my rescue cat really did rescue me.","Hey... I'm glad you're still here.

&#x200B;

Our pets can make the biggest differences, sometimes. Hold onto that, okay?"
12,Citalopram let the sun break through the clouds.,4,"Been having work related intrusive thoughts and anxiety and while the anxiety is still kind of there, I find it very easy to just put aside. I feel so zen, it's insane. Like I feel how I used to before getting a job--relaxed, able to rationalize my thoughts more efficiently, no more reckless driving, happy to see my niece/nephew when I wake up, etc. I actually was able to smile and chat with the cafeteria lady without being an anxious mess.

It is starting to show me that how I thought others perceived me was really all in my head.

I am still going to get in to see a psychologist at some point because I want to get to the root of the issue (I think I might have BPD), but for now I am just going to keep taking my Vyvanse and Citalopram, and will continue to practice mindfulness.

Feeling quite happy. ♥️","That's great to hear, I am happy for you, brother! Take care!"
13,I'm probably faking depression.,8,"Everything self-inflicted that I do seems like I'm just having desperate attempts at looking depressed when I'm not.

I'm just looking around and see others struggle and just beat myself up for them having real issues whilst I'm just making them up. But at the same time, I seem so, so damn entitled to try and look depressed.

I've been to hospital for mental health issues before, but it always gets twisted by my parents and it concludes to ""It's just my autism"". That just infuriates me so damn much. I fucking hate my Autism so much for this, I wish I never had it.

But maybe using this incriminating language just makes me look like I really am making it up because you know....I am.

I'm also....jealous.  I know people having diagnoses without much problem meanwhile I cut and attempt suicide multiple times and it's just always ""My Autism""
Man, I'm a piece of shit.

I just wish I was dead, but trying to do it would be nothing but a call for attention. I just want to be real. I don't know what to do anymore, I feel like I'll be dead before I become an adult.","Your autism will only hold you back if you let it, you have your whole life ahead of you. Your family would be heartbroken if you killed or harmed yourself please don’t do that. Life only gets better as you get older and the more you learn as you get older the easier life will get. There will be many beautiful moments in your life that you really don’t want to miss. Wether your faking depression or not if things seem tough now you will get through them to see happier times❤️"
14,My mom recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder and family is at each other’s throats. What do I do?,3,"
tldr; Asian household, in Canada, grandparents came to Canada to help my mom recover from BPD, but want to leave early because of differences with dad. Mom is still in hospital, what do I do? 

My mother (53F) has recently been hospitalized and is slowly but surely recovering from a depressive episode of BPD. It’s been about a week or two since she’s been admitted to the mental health ward, and a month since my grandparents came. 

A couple days ago, my grandparents told me that since they feel like they can’t help out much while my mom’s in the hospital, my grandfather’s heart condition, and the fact that I (21F) am home for the next three months and could help take care of her, they are thinking of leaving to go back to China early. 

Although they say that they’ll leave only once they get the “okay” from my mom, they’ve already packed their bags and have mentioned leaving in a couple days. Keep in mind they haven’t seen their daughter since she got admitted to the mental health ward at the hospital. 

Last night, my dad came home and he and my grandfather got into an altercation, where my grandfather claimed that my dad was being disrespectful to him and not taking care of my mom well enough, the same sentiment was voiced by my dad towards my grandfather.

As sort of the “fixer upper” of the family, I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if my grandparents leaving early will be detrimental to my mom when she is out of the hospital, but I also don’t know if I should be asking them to stay given that their mental and physical health seems to be deteriorating and clearly seem very prepared to leave and may have continued conflict with my dad. 

Also, does anyone have any advice when it comes to supporting a family member with BPD? Especially in transitioning out from hospital care and into day-to-day life? 

Thank you, any advice/support would be appreciated <3

edit: corrected mother for grandfather",don't burden yourself too much - you're not responsible for everyone's happiness.
15,I’m not a girl.,7,"
“Girly boy girly boy” “what are you a girl” “if you want to be a girl so bad why don’t I call you Delilah instead” “for someone who thinks they’re a boy you sure act like a bratty girl” “you’re 13 and still sound like a girl, what are you a tranny? Are you on estrogen or something you brat?” The repetition and your tone of voice made you sound like a 9 year old. Every time you’re angry you always go back to the same thing. You always go back to calling me a girl. Can you not think of anything new?
 
You were so proud of yourself and how you treated me. When we went to the record shop the man at the counter asked what we were looking for. I thought you weren’t mad at me anymore until you said “me and my daughter are just looking around” I froze when you said that. I was stuck between sobbing and yelling at you. But at the time my hair was down to my jaw and my voice was still pre pubescent. No one would believe me if I tried to fight back. Would they laugh?

When I was 11 I was 5’, had long wavy hair, a high voice, and I didn’t dress particularly masculine since most of the time I was in a school uniform of some sort. We couldn’t afford to buy new uniforms and my shorts were above my knees when they should have been below and my shirt was loose. I had a BMI of 14 so my legs and arms were effeminate, which fucking sucked because since it’s so god awfully hot here were usually showing. The only thing that would show that I wasn’t a girl was my face and name. Most people were either confused about my gender or knew I was a male, but when I met people and was with you they would all refer to me as a she. You told them my name was Dallas but since you kept calling me a she they all believed you. Even my grandma who knows I was born male calls me a female.

My mom told me that when you got mad at me you started telling my mom I was trans and that I was a girl. You weren’t satisfied with screaming at me in the car. You had to email her saying I was a “sissy boy” and start calling me a brat and plenty other things through text messages. When I blocked your number I got guilt tripped by both you and my mom to unblock you, which you just used to make me feel even more guilty.

Whenever you get mad you take all your anger out on me. It doesn’t matter what got you angry you will scream at me and then make me apologize. You’ll scream anything and everything you can in order to make me scared and then you’ll act like you’re the one whose hurt to make me feel bad for you. You say “if you don’t apologize I’ll never visit you again” which is childish to say the least but then every fucking day after that you’ll send “😭😢” which is SO FUCKING STUPID to the point where I’ll apologize just to get you to shut up. And then you’ll scream at me again. What did I do wrong?",You don't deserve that bullshit. I'm so sorry that you have to deal with that and you are such a strong human being. Sending you love and positive vibes.
16,Trying to be social is making me feel horrendous. I don't think it's worth it..,4,"Trying to be social and meet new people stresses me out so much I'm not sure I'll ever be able to get new friends.

I have avoidant personality disorder and have been pretty much friendless since I became a teenager. I'm now 26.

The other day I felt ready to put myself out there and challenge myself to download a friend-app and try to get in contact with some new people.

I found a couple of people and added them to a group chat. I also started writing with one other person outside the chat.

All of the people seem really nice and friendly. 

The thing is I still feel horribly stressed out chatting with them. I feel really uncomfortable and like I've lost all my sense of safety in my life. I feel uneasy and scared all day long. When I wake up and remember I now have people who wants to speak to me I feel physically unwell. It's like I have a responsibility.

I even agreed to meet up with one of them in ""the heat of the moment"" when I felt slightly confident, and now I just feel tormented and overwhelmed. I don't want to let that person down by canceling last moment. 

I really thought I wanted friends and could handle a friendly relationship, but this is agony for me mentally and physically, and all I'm doing is just having a casual text chat with these people. 

Today I have felt really down and almost slightly depressed because of it all. I feel really bad about myself and suddenly everything looks dark. 

It might sound like I'm overreacting, but I'm really not. I don't want to commit to any relationship because I'm terrified it'll put me in many more and even worse situations than this one. If I dive in to this too deep and make them think I am more capable then I am and then I suddenly don't want to talk or meet anymore then it has gone too far. 

I feel like I just might not ever be ready for a normal friendship. I've grown way too accustomed in my small, safe bubble. It feels like I don't even actually want a relationship with anyone.","Hi! I think it is natural to be uncomfortable and maybe scared when you talk to people you just met or made friends with in a few weeks or months. Being comfortable with each others' presence takes time and a lot of trust-building. My friends and I can go weeks and months not talking to each other and come back and talk again as if nothing happened. We are not obliged to fully commit to talk to each other every week but we know we will always have each other's backs if things go wrong.

Sometimes you just have to care more about the people than making the friendship work and maybe stop idealising about friendship. I don't think relationships are meant to be perfect and you might need to slow down if you don't want to fully commit. Genuine people will always care for you no matter what. You learn to adjust and they adjust as well.

I hate scheduling meet-ups as well even with my friends but once I am with them I feel happy and suddenly I feel like all my effort of going to our meeting place was worth it.

You are actually doing great and tried to reach out and made friends. Don't feel so down about it :)"
17,"Vent, maybe other stuff",2,"So, first post. Lately my depression has been flaring up, in all the bad ways.

19,Does depression affect your intelligence and memory? If so what can be done to help get you back to the way you were before?,103,"I’ve had depression and anxiety since I was 15 (now 22) and I feel like I can’t recall a lot anymore, I get confused easily and have trouble understanding things. It’s affecting me a lot and only making me more anxious. Had anyone else had problems like this and if so how have you overcome it (if you have)?",I experienced such. Psychotherapy helps. Best to find a Registered Psychometrician or a Social worker in your area. You may also talk to your Psychiatrist about it.
20,PSA about anyone in this sub claiming to be a Therapist,133,"Or any other Professional licensed or unlicensed. Take their claims with a grain of salt.  r/therapy does not verify anyone in the sub who claims to be a therapist.

21,Jealous of those with family support,34,Does anyone else feel this way? It comes out as bitterness towards some friends. It is bitterness but I’m just wondering if anyone else has this issue and we can discuss it.,"Me right here!!

I’ve always been jealous, I had a very unstable family growing up, and still do. I get no support at all from them lol. Now my mom is sick with cancer and it’s honestly just even worse.

I’ve always been so jealous of my friends who have stable and supportive parents."
22,I don’t think I can ever go for therapy,2,"For the past couple of months my friend online has encouraged me to try out therapy. But, there are many problems that I need to face first.

First of all, it is important to note that I have grown up having a specific notion about what a mental health condition should be like. Like my family, I had conformed to the stereotypical idea about how, for instance, you need to shave your head in order to be categorized as mentally unstable, or you need to have severe panic attacks to have genuine anxiety. 

But, my recognition of my own issues conflicted with these ideas. I began to think that my problems weren’t big enough to be addressed. That I needed to show physical evidence of emotional suffering in order to get the attention I deserved. 

Now this will probably make you sick, but at this point I was really suffering. From low self esteem, anxiety and loneliness but didn’t think my problems big enough to be addressed. And so I started lying to myself about how I was suffering much more than I actually was, to gain the sympathy and attention of not only other people, but myself too. 

Although, I recognize that I have the tendency to exaggerate my suffering, it is something that happens naturally at this point. I don’t know how to get out of this cycle of self-pitying. 

Now, I really want to see a therapist because I feel like my problems need to be addressed. But, like me, my parents also hold similar beliefs about what mental health issues should look like. I don’t know how to tell them that I don’t have to shave my head (no offense) to show them that I am suffering. At least, I don’t want my issues to go as far as that before they are addressed. 

I am certain they aren’t going to understand if I talk to them, because their money is on the line. But I just feel so helpless right now.

Edit: Grammar","Even if there was nothing wrong with you (which I doubt) why keep yourself in this suffering state? You wouldn‘t even know how great life could be for you if you never adress your issues.
My parent also never thought mental health was something to take serious, so I went to a therapist without their knowing. Turns out, I need it. My family will find out eventually."
23,Im lonely,3,"Hi reddit. 

I guess im doing alright. Im a bit angry at my boss because i think he's being unreasonable. But it's alright. Im going to try my best and control my anger in front of him tomorrow.  I asked for the day off 6 days in advance (I was told 2 days in advance was fine the first week) and he said that my ""excuse"" didnt seem mandatory. But it's literally one of the most important things to me. Anyways, im just going to nod and say yes to whatever lecture he throws at me tomorrow. I love working with the costomers most times and my coworkers like me, so it'll be fine. 

Im mostly really lonely and sad. 
Im a trans guy (born female=> male), and I feel really out of place in my body and the world. My parents don't support me. They sent me to conversion therapy. It was two years ago, but yesterday i was had a moment of intense flashbacks and i almost accidentally ended my life while  trying to stop the memories from flooding back.

My two best friends are in relationships and i cant say im not jealous. One of them even has a good relationship with their parents. I want, more than anything to be hugged by someone who loves me and accepts me. 

I dont drink anymore (I get really angry/violent), but I want to. I dont smoke. Actually grateful I quit before i got too into it. But i want to numb the pain so sometimes when I want to feel good I'll masturbate, but honestly; ive been so put off by  my body, and i just... am down?

My therapist thought I was doing better, because im managing my depression/anxeity pretty well but am I really though? Because i don't feel any better.

I want a hug.",[removed]
24,Anxiety: Am I Avoiding getting better or doing what I need to be doing?,1,"A couple months ago, I had a pretty bad anxiety episode, full-on panic attacks, the whole nine yards.

I've been spending the last month and change trying to ""get better"".  Right now, I feel great unless I start thinking ""am I feeling anxious?"" Then, it starts to spiral.

To combat this, I'm trying to get busy every time my mind goes there.  Go outside and do some yard work, exercise.  And usually it stops it.  Because I'm not really feeling anxious as much as I feel like I'm talking myself into being anxious because it's a bad pattern.  

My concern is, am I actually remedying the situation in a good way through distraction, or am I just avoiding my anxiety?

Ultimately, I'd like to develop some patterns and skills to help cope when things get bad again.  A lot of my coping mechanisms a few months ago didn't work AT ALL for the first time ever.  But when you read up on it, there seems to be a mix of opinions if distraction is just an avoidance tactic or a legitimate way to set your mind in a different direction.",[removed]
25,Huh? Counselors telling friends kids they don't need a relationship with their other parent.,3,"Recently, friends from different families divulged that they have been going through some ups and downs as their kids are working through the teenage years (13-16 years of age). They talked about the immense amount of stress their children feel. God we all remember those miserable days, don't we. Anyhow, the kids are in therapy which doesn't seem unusual or out of place. Please keep in mind that one is a childhood friend and the other a college buddy. These conversations took place recently, but at different times. They don't know one another. 

Both families include children from previous relationships. Obviously, I knew both prior the demise of their relationships. Everyone involved seemed like decent people but, for one reason or another, things just didn't work out. Hardworking middle class folks with good jobs. Not criminals. Not abusive. Not alcoholics or prone to illicit substances. 

It was eerie that both blamed their ex/non-custodial parent as a significant source of the stress in their children's lives. To quote them: 

Mom:  ""It would be easier for my daughter if her father would just move on. I keep telling her she doesn't have to see or talk to him. So does her therapist.""

Dad: ""I wish she would just let the kids be. We have a good thing here. The counselor says that now that they are *of age* they don't have to continue a relationship with her.""

Their attitudes were incredibly selfish, toxic! I couldn't believe they made the statements in front of their kids. They both seemed to have develop fairly agreeable relationships with their ex. And boy, does this make me grateful to be a single dog dad! I had no idea what to say to them then or now. I feel like informing the other parent, but these are my people. I'm disappointed in them and the counselors. 

As a child of divorce, I get the laws. If its true what they said about the therapists, this is the exact opposite of what I was told in counseling by a therapist when I during my teenage years. My dad just left and rarely called, wrote, or visited. These kids don't have that (abandonment). The complaints honestly seemed to begrudge the inconveniences of the non-custodial parent. 

Please explain to me what hell is going on in the counseling world that A) the non-custodial parent (still a legal guardian) isn't informed that their child(ren) is/are in therapy, B) requested to be involved in therapy, and C) why counselors are telling these kids that they don't have to maintain a relationship with the other parent. This doesn't seem ethical. 

**TL/DR:** Why are therapists telling kids that they don't have to see their non-custodial parent without ever conversing with that parent? Seems shady.","Maybe there are things going on that you don't know about.  Nobody knew my ex was a psychopath.  He was dangerous and violent and reveled in seeing people in fear and pain.  He was also charming and everybody loved him.  

I'm not saying that there's anything that severe, but children are normally pretty darn attached to parents, even fairly abusive ones.  It's a red flag that the kids don't want a relationship with a parent, especially if a therapist agrees with not having a relationship.  Also, nowadays custody is normally shared unless something is seriously wrong with one of the parents.  That's a red flag as well.  That's not a normal arrangement for two awesome co-parenting parents to have.

If the children are stressed about seeing a non-custodial parent, maybe there is a reason why.  If a therapist is listening and saying that it's okay to distance themselves from that parent, maybe there is a reason why.

What you see isn't always the truth.  People don't often want to share all of the sordid details with friends."
26,Feeling down,1,"I'm a pre-med student with a ton of responsibilities and goals, but lately the stress has been getting to me. A couple of weeks ago I actually got sick from being stressed out, which was a first for me. It really made me feel worried for my health. I know that stress is something we should try to keep to a healthy minimum, but it is a bit difficult with the path that I chose in my life. I do not think I made the wrong decision in my life path, and I know that I want to pursue medicine. However, due to the recent occurrence of me getting sick over stress, I feel like I developed some type of trauma, and now I feel more stress about my health then my grades. Long story short, I got over my sickness, but every now and then I feel like I might be getting sick again (even though I am not). Any advice to help overcome these thoughts?","My advice some might roll their eyes at but it's something that stuck with me these past years. For the record I'm the same; if I am stressed, I get sick, either catching colds, running fevers, or nausea. My first semester in fact I was sick from October til January. I would improve for 2-6 days and then be incredibly sick again.

But what stuck with me: a teacher showed us a TED Talk about stress. The lady was citing a study conducted over the years. Basically they followed the lives of a group that viewed stress as a good thing and the other group that viewed stress as a bad thing. The latter was more prone to illnesses both physical and/or mental and lived generally shorter lives.

Anyways her point was that how we frame our stress can ease the pressure a bit on us. Of course it's not great at all to be under tons and tons of stress as we feel in college or medical school, etc. But this stress is inevitable, naturally.

It's good to hear you recognize that you truly are passionate about medicine: let that sink in as your reasoning for (some of) the stress being good. Stress might be propelling you to strive to learn all you can. It's motivating you to do your best to understand medicine so that you can be a really excellent practicing doctor in the future. If you can harness it, a good amount of the stress you are feeling can be a friend. Sometimes you can't fight it, instead, work alongside it willingly, not reluctantly. Reframe how you're approaching stress in mindset.

And of course there is the stress that cannot be worked with willingly. As a medical student you know how important wellness is so doing the small organizational things you can do can help ease the other side of stress a bit. Just tidying something up for ten minutes can give us a bit of a feeling that we are getting things together, and it's okay if things aren't together all the time."
27,Autistic and dumb,3,"I thought I was friends with multiple people for nearly a year online, they were really close to me in my eyes. Eventually tonight I mustve drove one over the edge because they snapped and I lost communication with all but one of them. The guy who I thought was my friend unblocked me and after talking with him he just told me I was annoying, and have always been annoying. He never liked me and we were never friends, and he just kept in touch because we played the same games. I thought he was joking but I realized he wasn't and he eventually just told me to stop messaging him since I was still annoying him. I thought that guy was my friend, we did a ton of shit together and I really liked him. I don't know what to do, how do I stop being so annoying and autistic? I just want to be able to form regular human connections with people without them despising me","I'd like to ask you age if possible?

I had close contact with an autistic person before. they seem to miss social clues very easily. This is not necessarily a sign of dumbness. The way I heard (which might not be true) is that autism correlates with lower empathy ability.

Online relationships are already difficult for all of us in terms of picking up social clues. So it's not very  surprising that you missed some. Maybe you should seek friends in real life where social clues are more self evident. You can train yourself to pick them up if it doesn't naturally occur to you. There are people who managed this and life reasonably normal lives.

I hope you the very best:)"
28,How do I ghost my therapist without being rude,12,"3 sessions he didn't remember anything I told him. He just called me to tell me he needs to cancel tomorrow. I won't have my 4th session for another week. I'm in need of help and I'm realizing im the only one I can help, myself. How do I get out of therapy without having to talk to him. It's paid for by medical.",Just tell him that it's not working for you and you feel that it's not a good fit. I would start looking for another one already but I'd advise not to ghost them. Just be professional. It's your right anyway to stop whenever you want.
29,What is therapy like?,3,"I'm in a pretty bad head space right now and 
I think I need therapy. But I'm not sure if it's worth it. So if you don't mind talking about it: what sort of things do you do in therapy and how has it helped you?","I've been in therapy for going on three years now, and it's the best thing I ever did. Early in my therapy process, we talked mostly about coping mechanisms for my anxiety and depression, and some about my relationships and my dissociation issues. Mostly targeting techniques to help with what I came in for. Now I've been diagnosed with a bunch more stuff and have realized a lot of crap about my life (definitely not everyone's experience, btw! Just how it worked out for me, I was repressing a lot of stuff) and I deal a lot more with trauma processing and focusing on my childhood. Therapy will vary greatly based on the needs of the client, but for us we've done pretty much everything; I've showed her videos and songs that represent how I'm feeling, we've drawn pictures together, a whole bunch of things. For me, therapy has definitely been a ""it gets worse before it gets better"" type of experience, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. Tl;dr therapy is great, 10/10 would recommend."
30,I am at a loss with my ex,2,"So about three weeks ago I split up with my girlfriend of 5 months. She was/is a great girl and girlfriend. In the beginning we had a lot of fun and I really enjoyed life with her in it. After around the third month though, my feelings began to change about her and the idea of furthering the relationship. Without going into graphic detail, let's just say that the intimacy between us stopped. Soon resentment began followed by bickering to the point that I felt it needed to end. The issue is that she is very distraught over the breaking, and so although it pains me greatly, I have tried my hardest to have broken contact with her, at least for the time being...until last night. She text me say ""I left something on your front porch for you. Merry Christmas"". I get home to receive a monogrammed money clip, and limited edition flask, socks, and some weed. She finally started listening to me. Now I don't know what to do. My feelings haven't changed as far as wanting to be apart, I just don't know what to do or say now. Do I keep them knowing I won't use these things? Do I try and give them back? What what what?",[deleted]

As soon as we get back to my place I just wanna veg on the couch and be left alone but she wants to cuddle or wants a tickle or a massage then sex and I don't is this normal or is it the end??? We've only been dating for a year and a halfish,"Are these feelings limited to just your girlfriend or are you shutting yourself off from the world at every corner besides work? 
This sounds strange to hear but loss of sexual desire and passion for your girlfriend might not just be a sign of a relationship ending, as these are all ways that depression can show in men. 
Other signs can be loss of motivation, fatigue, sleep issues (too much or too little), irritably, anxiety and substance abuse.

I was seeing this girl this year for 6 months but she was suffering from depression which really impacted the relationship. Things didn't end well at all. A couple weeks after we ended things we found out that she had a miscarriage and during all this time she has been quite a 'mess'. I have tried to be there for her because she has no one else to be there for her but at the same time she keeps constantly talking about her feelings and saying she wants to get back together after i repeatedly say that i can only be there for her as a friend. 

Now i really messed up last night. She was kicked out of home for a few days and i told her that she could stay the night at mine. She sat in her car from 6pm to midnight (which is when i told her i would be free because she insisted on me not cancelling on hanging out with friends) but after gym i met up with a girl who i slept with. I ended up calling my ex at 1am telling her she could sleep in my bed and i would have the sofa but she no longer wanted to come because she thought it was too late to drive.

40,Introducing the Advice Point and User Flair System,74,"## **Officially launched Open Beta. Feedback appreciated! Please comment your thoughts below.**

See the TL;DR stickied comment for a summary. 

---

Hello advice givers! **We are proud to announce that we are currently testing out a new system.** You will be able to earn points for providing advice, and earn flair levels too. 

Right now, we think that on average, threads do not receive enough helpful advice. There is no incentive to be helpful! Many people ask for advice every day, and a lot of these requests go unnoticed or ignored. We also think that thread creators don't respond enough. We want to encourage both for a more vibrant and robust community. 

**So, we are introducing our Advice Point system!** 


---

## **How it works**

Whenever OP submits a thread, the automoderator will provide a comment with instructions. Long story short, if OP responds to a comment with the word ""helped"" in any way, the commenter will receive an **Advice Point.**

Your Advice Point score can be seen on your user flair. This is a little title that's next to your name. The more points you get, the cooler your title. Here's a list of what we have so far. 

**TLDR: If you are OP, please respond to comments with the word ""Helped"". If you are a commenter, don't do anything different, just remind OP to respond with that specific word if they find your comment helpful.**

Point Requirement | Title 
---|---
1 Point | Helper
5 Points | Unlicensed Counselor
10 Points | Expert Advice Giver
20 Points | Master Advice Giver
40 Points |  Phenomenal Advice Giver
60 Points | Advice Guru
100 Points | Advice Oracle
150 Points | Enlightened Advice Sage
200 Points | Assistant Elder Sage
300 Points | Elder Sage 

---

## **So what's the point of this?**

Well, nothing really. But we have found that people generally like to be helpful. We want to give recognition to the people who have helped our community. These people deserve to be commended and praised for their help, and this is how we want to do it. 

There is no monetary benefit, and having a higher rank title doesn't make your advice any more important than anyone else's. However, it will show the history of your helpfulness. 


---

## **Helpful tips**

- Only OP can award points. If you are not OP, and you use the word ""helped"" in your comment, automod will let you know that no points will be awarded.
- OP can award 1 point per person per thread. 
- OP can award 1 point to *multiple* people in the thread. All advice is helpful and if OP got helped by everyone, that's fantastic!

---

## **We will test this system out for a minimum of one month, to give users a chance to chime in and provide their opinions.** 

Please be patient with us, as this will be an Open Beta test, **you may experience minor bugs or issues**. Please feel free to let us know if anything goes wrong. If people are not happy with this system, we will remove it and return things to normal. 

Finally, feel free to include any suggestions or thoughts below. Happy advice-giving!","Seems to me you're just encouraging responders to reply with what the OP wants to hear in hopes of getting a gold star stuck to their forehead instead of replying with valid advice which I thought was the purpose of this group.  Good advice is often going to be exactly the opposite of what the OP wants to hear.

Is there some way to block this flair from appearing on ones profile if they wish to do so?  I personally find it extremely offensive that you are assigning people with no training the title of unlicensed counselor with no proof that they've completed the educational requirements that are required to gain that title.  I would ask that you rethink the name for that one."
41,Update on some /r/advice rules.,16,"There have been an increasing amount of issues recently relating to whether or not some posts are real and how users react to that. I would like to make everybody aware on our stance here.

&#x200B;

User come to this sub with a large variety of issues. Some of these are going to seem fake, and potentially many of them are but some will just really be that outrageous and genuine. We have decided that where it's not 100% certain that a post is made up, we are going to lean onto the side of the post being real and allow it. We believe the priority lies in the users needing help over the spam in the sub and we would rather a spammer get through than a users genuine post be removed.  We are continuing our efforts to deal with the spammers in the sub but we don't want to get redditors needing advice caught up in that.

On the back of that we have seen a lot of redditors speaking directly to OP calling them fake and on occasion harassing said user. I want to remind everyone that the sub rules apply and even if you think a post is fake and that action may be taken if we find users can't behave properly.

So i'm making this post to describe my circumstances, why I can/can't do certain things one would expect, my alternate ideas of approaching, etc. As an attempt to get advice from anywhere I can (even from randoms online) before making a move.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\> How do you know? What makes you say this?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That's a bit of a story, so sit tight. Although i'll nutshell where I can. To begin, my mom & dad were married for I think abt 23 years. He was very abusive towards her, and this continued from when they were kids, to when they got divorced 2 years ago.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When I was growing up, he was very abusive to my sisters, but for some reason not to me. His main catch phrase when he was angry (if you were to ask me for one) was ""I feel like taking a gun and shooting you all in the back of the fucking head"".

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'd like to say i'm strong, but parts of me knows i'm not, because that must have left some mark on me even though i've been kept out of it. I say this, because for example: He could be outside down the street, and I could be upstairs in my room. If he sneezes from all the way out there, there's a chance it makes me flinch & gives me a small moment of anxiety (butterflies in your chest I guess one could call it). So as much as i'd like to say ""i've been brave"", I know a part of me isn't.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Though right now that doesn't matter. To continue, once me and my sisters were all grown, my mom decided to make the choice to divorce him abt 2 years ago as i've stated. She knew the danger him doing it in person brought. So she told me to gather my things one day in the morning, and she borrowed a friends car, and drove us a few states away over the course of a few days, just for us to be safe. i’ll admit, due to it being so sudden, we argued about it, but I eventually said ok as I realized how dangerous he was, and knowing I had nobody to turn to that’d willingly take me in for the time being to keep me safe, everyone that did know, was too scared to even interact with my mom regarding the situation. Though anyways, It turns out, she was right, within the first few hours, my sisters (who pretended to know nothing when speaking with my dad), got calls from them, saying “they have 24 hours to come back, or something bad will happen”, or him mentioning he’s going to kill someone.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After a few days, due to both him legitimately calming down, and my mom realizing “this was a bad choice to run away like this” (she’s what one would call “financially illiterate”, so she’s making bad financial choices that made that run away she took me on dangerous as time continued. Sadly, lives in her own “it needs to be my way too” world in some ways), we came home, but she lived in her own apartment now. It was really hard for him, and as much as I wouldn't care if he disappeared or not, I was there for him to prevent the worst from happening: Him snapping, and killing me, my sisters, my mother, then himself. Thankfully, simply being there was a help, as he directly told me the only reason he hasn't snapped and killed everyone is cause i'm there in the house and haven't ditched him too.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As much as that sounds nice & wholesome, let me elaborate the reality of it: It's not. Sadly, he has the mentalities of ""I want things to be the way I want them to be, if they're not my way, I will be angry"", and ""If we're arguing, and you do not submit and say i'm right, I will see that as violence towards me, and retaliate because in my mind \_I\_ see that as you attacking me. What do I think if i'm attacked? I should attack back, because according to me. You're attacking me"", and ""I will get angry if you talk back, and hit you if I have to"", and ""if you do not do these things, I am angry, and will constantly start arguments about it, mentally degrading you until \_you\_ snap."". I could definitely go on. Though the moral of it, is me being there being a blockade of him snapping, in reality is his last mental grasp of having someone to abide by all the mentalities that I've stated above.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He's also a manipulator. He does all I've stated above, and pushes many in my family to their mental limits, till  \_they\_ snap at him. Then he has the audacity to say things around the theme of ""wow, if you're acting like that you really need therapy and help. You're sick in the head"".

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Though honestly, i'm digressing. After my mom divorced him, he had his mental breakdowns. But up to 2+ years later, he still doesn't tell anyone he's known, he still walks around saying ""me and my wife"" to everyone he talks to, he still says ""She left me, I didn't leave her"" to me when he's angry, says ""he'll snap"" at anyone if he finds out they've told someone about their divorce, and I could go on. He still says all the things he has since day 1 of the divorce, and it's sad.It's morphed into his own echo chamber, where logic is backwards and the world is his own image, and his own image is moral law. I know this because in arguments he gets mad at common sense, and states ""everyone in the world will agree with me"", ""anyone you come across will react like <X>"",  etc. When I try to reason with him? Complete denial, and he pushes his mentalities I've stated above till the argument stops out of me just telling him he's right, or him walking away holding in all the anger not processing anything I've said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Over time, he's said things such as ""you better get ready <my name>, pretty soon you're gonna have to live on your own"". Of course, you can see the subtle implications, but to assume is the same as making up a scenario in my mind. So I didn't let those things get to me. Though, that evolved to ""pretty soon you're not gonna have a mother and father anymore"", then ""if your mother keeps this up i'm gonna do what I gotta do, watch"", then ""watch, she's messing with me like this, and pretty soon I might have to eliminate people. There's that <person> too, I bet she's involved in this too, i'm gonna visit her too"".

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It got worse and worse, he even turns on those he thinks are “not on the right side”, and even towards my sisters who’ve stayed neutral, he’s said “I’m gonna have to hurt everyone at this point, you take that as a threat”. I've confronted him about it in the past, though he denied and denied. I've told him that even though he's like this he has family and friends who are concerned. He has people who care about him. People who are willing to talk to him and help him till he's better. Though he denies it, and says things around the theme of ""Worry about yourself <my name>, don't worry about me, pretty soon you'll have to worry about yourself only and you won't have any help"". He doesn’t want therapy, he doesn’t want help, he’s slowly breaking his possessions so he’ll have little to care about. He's got nothing to live for at this point, and nothing can change his mind, unless his surroundings change to the way he wants them to be. Sad thing is, he doesn't want to acknowledge that they won't.Though today, he openly said it. ""Pretty soon i'm going to snap, and i'm going to kill your mother"", ""that's right, i'm gonna take a gun then shoot her in the fucking head, then shoot myself, go ahead and tell her all you want, I don't give a fuck"", ""you don't think it's gonna happen, but you're gonna be shocked when it does"". So after years of hinting messages he gave, he finally admitted it, and i'm finally gonna speak up about it for the sake of myself and those I care for.I know I run the risk of him finding out about this, and I may die, as him seeing this would mean “you’re on the side of your mother, you have to go too”. Though in that case, it's better to speak and know you tried, rather than not speaking up at all. There’s much more I can say, but as it stands these are my circumstances. Apologies if I seemed emotional, or made a tangent on some points that didn’t matter, as I know I need to get straight to the point. Though let’s continue.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\> Why say you can’t do anything, aren’t you overreacting?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Well, both yes and no. Yes, because obviously, I can go to the police, I can try to find someone willing to help me, etc.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But no, because I currently don’t work or go to school (i’ll elaborate soon), this makes me very homebound, and I live in a neighborhood where people like to run their mouths. If people see me do either, they’ll recognize it as suspicious activity and notify my father (innocently, not understanding how that’s bad, and I can’t walk around to everyone saying don’t speak abt seeing me, otherwise they’ll tell my father that, and that’s bad news), and i’ll be on his hit list.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My father also calls my phone about 1-6 times a day from the time I wake up, to the time he gets home from work. If I don’t pick up, he panics, and calls more, if I do not pick up then, he’ll call people in the neighborhood to spot me out cause he’ll be “worried”. So that eliminates going anywhere outside when he’s not home at any given time.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When he is home, well, that’s obvious, he’ll know everywhere I go if I try to go anywhere, and refusal to tell him where I go will = in a downwards spiral of arguing (if you’ve made it this far you know what I mean). What makes it worse is that I don’t have any friends nearby, only friends maybe like, 20+ blocks away, so I can’t say “oh i’m seeing a friend”, he’ll know i’m bullshitting.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

To elaborate on not going to school/having a job, i’m simply too scared to get a job/go to college, because if I do, he’ll be here alone with his thoughts, and that’s when he gets his worse. For those who forgot, remember where I mention him saying the only reason he hasn’t snapped, is because i’m still in the house. If I get a job or take schooling that eliminates me from seeing him when I do, that =’s him snapping, since I am no longer there. I can’t take an online course too, he won’t accept that as acceptable since that’s not his way of doing things.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Essentially, i’m trapped in a giant free-roam cage within my neighborhood, and have limited choices as to what I can do.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\> What are your alternate ideas?

Based on my circumstances, my alternate idea I have that’d be the most simple, and imo, the most effective. Is to secretly record him saying these things, as he says them nearly daily. Then go to the police with the recordings.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don’t feel safe doing the reverse, as if I go to the police without proof, they can’t do much, and my father will find out, and presumably kill me, or worse. On top of that, i’ve always heard horror stories about these scenarios, and just bad stories about people stepping up to do the right thing being the ones punished. I’m scared i’ll run into that. Additionally, remember the thing I said about the job and school? Yeah, do to that, I don’t have finances to spend on my own place, thus trapping me under a rock of dependency. So if I go to the police and have nothing concrete to lock him up (or at the very least get him away from me) quick and fast, it’s game over.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Not to mention, this dependency factor has held me captive till the age of 19, and yes, I agree “why not get a job?”, “you’re 19, do things yourself”, “you’re 19??? You’re not a damn kid anymore, who cares?”. I know.. I know, i’m 19. Though due to everything I said from the start of this till now. I’m trapped. For those who are wondering, I live in NY. I realize now that not elaborating on that may be confusing, i’m deeply sorry if it has been. Plus as far as i'm aware, in cases like mine, due to my age law enforcement won't care as i'm no longer a minor, so that makes things more worrisome as not even the law will be wanting to help me. On top of that, although i'm have strength, i'd be too scared to ever act in self defense if he's come at me (and he has once before), as if I hurt him due to my overpowering factor, i'm pretty sure that will just go against me, and the law won't care about my circumstance (they'll just see ""you hurt > you're a criminal > jail time"").

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\> To conclude.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

These are my circumstances, why I can’t do the normal things to get help one would typically expect, and my alternate ideas on what I can do to stay safe. I know i’m not perfect, so to think my alternate idea is the one true way to help myself is close minded. I posted this here due to the anonymity it will give me, and will be posting it on other subreddits for help, I can only hope that this gets noticed, so that I can get as many brains helping me out as I can.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I think this is all I had to say, with gushing my heart out, I don’t know what will happen next. This is either going to gain traction, and I can have people give me their thoughts like I was hoping, or it may flop as an accusation of “the worlds biggest copy pasta”, I really, \_really\_ hope it doesn’t.. If I left anything out, I can’t remember it at the moment due to how nerve racking making this is. Though for now, I’ll I can say is:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Please, help me.","First off, I agree with recording what he says in secret, starting asap. Set it up so that if he sees the recorder it looks like it just turned on by accident (i.e - phone in your pocket). Meanwhile, take every baby step possible to get out. If you feel completely paralyzed with fear, I get it. I know what you're going through - your'e in a mental prison seeing barriers at every turn, but you CAN leave. However it's better to move slowly than be paralyzed with fear of taking the leap. See if your father will mention the threats again (killing your mother) while recording. It might actually serve you as comfort knowing that his abuse is being documented and will bite him back in the ass. Maybe there is a neighbour who you can trust to start opening up to."
43,My gf and I want to get married. Her whole family has rings like 3c sized. I know it sounds way too big. I can only afford a diamond like 3/4c. But she’s freaking out about the diamond size bc of her family standards. Does this tell you anything? Any advice wanted/appreciated. 1 year in. TIA,27,,Its a fucking ring for fucks sake does she love you or the ring huh?
44,I don't feel comfortable in my own home,370,"Hey there, I'm an 18-year-old seeking for some advice.

I'm an introverted, quiet person who suffers from depression and feels lonely some times, not necessarily because I'm actually lonely, but because of some social anxiety and the fear of losing the people I love.

Something Important I got to say is that my friends are the most important people to me, I love them and the 5 close friends I have feel more like a family to me than my actual family because I feel comfortable being myself around them and I can open up easily to them. It was my birthday recently, and they organized a surprise for me, that's the kind of stuff that makes me feel loved and that a have a place in life.

I did a stupid thing, I skipped a class in college and missed the final exam because I was already failing and didn't think it was worth spending more time in the class anyway. I decided not to tell my parents about it and just focus on my grades in the other classes so I would have a good mean anyway. Yesterday, the teacher somehow contacted my parents and told them all about this situation. Needless to say, they got really mad, I get it, it was a bad mistake and they have every right to be upset. What's been shaking my anxiety is the fact that they are treating me (mainly my dad) as a total deception, saying things like ""we used to be proud of you"" ""you are getting everything wrong"" ""you just can't stop being a liar, you don't know what truth is"" ""your future is going to be bad"".

I've been dealing with this and just have been inside the house all weekend, my anxiety is building up and I'm feeling trapped here. It's worst when I got to sleep. When I was a little kid, and I was staying at a relatives house for the first time, I got this anxiety-like feeling that wouldn't allow me to sleep, it was a sign that I didn't felt comfortable and just wanted to be in my house as usual or something.

I hadn't had felt like this in years and that feeling has suddenly come back. I don't feel comfortable living or sleeping here, I feel like a stranger, I feel lonely, I feel anxious and depressed, there's this feeling of emptiness that hurts. I wish I were with the people I love, with friends, just chatting, just being in a calm place.

Before you say anything, moving out or getting out of the house isn't really an option, I have nowhere to go and I depend economically on my parents and wouldn't really know how to face the world all by myself in that way. Sorry for my little tantrum.

Thanks for reading me out, whoever you are.","Woah, are you telling me your college instructor contacted the parents of an adult student to inform them of your academics?

Report this instructor to the Dean, the instructor violated your privacy and possibly laws depending on where you live...and most certainly college employment policies.

Advice for the parent situation: 

1. Let them calm down for a couple more days
2. Sit them down and talk to them. Explain what you said here, that you bit off more than you could chew with the course load. I assume this is your first year in college. Explain how things got out of hand and when you were flailing you made a stupid decision.
3. Tell them you'll take a more reasonable course load in the future and let them know you'll inform them early if you're having difficulties (not that it's any of their business but it seems like they want to be involved).

45,I suck at talking to people.,105,"So I was in a voice call with my friend earlier and we were talking and it got silent because no one knew what to say and then she said ""so do you ever start a conversation?"". This made me realise that she is always the one to start a conversation and I'm never able to, which usually leads to a lot of awkward silences. What can I do to get better at speaking to her?","I've always had a philosophy to never force a convo. Speak about your life, her life, and both of your goals. I don't know how close you are, but if you're really close, you can speak about life issues. 

The best kinds of friends are those you can share an awkward silence with (one that doesn't feel awkward). 

Don't think about it too much. It's simple really, speak about anything that interests you. If you have nothing to say, no need to speak. If both of you are ok with, you can just enjoy each other's company in silence!"
46,Is there any actual reason to live for nowadays?,57,"Hey, guys
I'm in my teens rn and it's probably just a phase, and it's not like I want to kill myself or stuff like that, but, honestly, I feel like after college and stuff, life just becomes absolutely meaningless, people live blinded by work, bills to pay, and their only moment of brief happiness is, like, a Friday or saturday night, when they hang out and/or have a drink with some friends, just to wake up hungover the next day and remember just how f***ed up life is, and spend the whole week just waiting for the next friday, just to start the cicle once again, and honestly, I don't see a way out of this crap, and I feel like passion is dead, because I see people, even my parents, just empty, staring at their phones, and they have no passion for what they do, always complaining about work, but, again, there's no way out of it, because most of the times, the stuff you like doing won't get you enough cash to survive, then you'll need to get some boring job that you don't like, alongside people you don't like, and for the last months or so I've been trying to figure out some good reason to live, and that's why I came here on r/advice, to know what's your reason to keep going everyday","Because I know that no matter how hard I try, I'll never manage to read all the good books. A book lover never goes to bed alone."
47,Recently homeless and still scared,13,"As the title suggests, I’ve lost my place to live. Tomorrow I might lose my car and I will have nowhere to sleep and I’m scared. 

Long story short, I was forced to put a resignation at my job about 3 months ago, forcing me to look for work through temp agencies. I’ve still been applying elsewhere, but the (inconsistent) work I get from agencies is my only income currently. I’ve no college experience and am only 22 so I find it very difficult to get a job that can support me financially. About 2 months into losing my job and daily harassment from my landlord, I decided to move into my car until I can find consistent work and save up for a place to stay. I chose to pay my car payment rather than rent because I need to pay it on time so I can refinance after a year, because my current payments are $400 + $200 for full coverage and I need so bad for those payments to go down. I’m a week into living in my car and I accidentally killed my battery charging my phone. I should’ve been asleep an hour ago to get my full 8 hours for work, but the anxiety is keeping me awake. I sleep in a wal mart parking lot that allows 24 hour parking, but I don’t know if they will have my car towed for being parked over 24 hours. I have no family or friends who can help me. I plan on asking a coworker for a jump after work, assuming I’m not towed by then. 

I guess I’m just at a loss. I want to cry, but I can’t. I can’t even describe the way I feel. Life has already be so, so hard. That job was the greatest thing to happen to me, and because one specific person didn’t like me and had enough power, I was forced to either resign or be fired. I have been doing my best to stay positive, see the silver lining. But it’s so hard. I’m not suicidal, I’m too scared to follow through with something like that, but I’ve found myself fantasizing about it more and more. I just want so bad to not be so stressed. I have no one and nothing but a laundry bag full of clothes and a couple things in a cheap storage unit so I have room to sleep in my car. I just got my food stamps card today so of course that helps, but my biggest concern right now is my car. Because I am a temp, my “assignment will end” (aka I’ll be fired) if I miss any work. So I have to choose between possibly losing my car, or my current source of income. If it gets impounded I won’t be able to get it out, i will be paying payments on a car I can’t use. I don’t know what to do. I’m likely just venting at this point. Thank you for reading, any response would be appreciated just to know there’s people out there.","At your age, have you considered joining the military?

48,Can this relationship work out without one of them being totally miserable?,3, Two young people get married. One really really really wants children and the other REALLY doesn't want any. Do you think their relationship is doomed from the start or is there a way for both of them to be happy?,There is no way this can work out. I will never understand why people sweep this HUGE difference between what people want from life under the rug and expect a relationship to work out.
49,Is showering 2x a day generally bad for you?,3,"Lol this seems like such an odd question. When I google it, I just get a whole bunch of dermatologist linked blogs instead of a straight answer. I only wash my hair 2-3x a week, and scrub my body with dove soap for sensitive skin.  I have a pretty good AM/PM skincare routine, and usually moisturize before bed.

I used to never shower 2x a day. However, now that I have back issues, I wake up with a really stiff back. Taking a warm shower and doing some light stretching really helps get rid of stiffness. After my work day, I usually do some sort of exercise. Gym, yoga, biking, walk/jog, whatever. Usually I have a good sweat worked up and don’t feel comfortable changing into clean clothes and laying down when I feel gross. 

My coworkers were talking about how bad it is to actually shower every day. Since my skin is a little more tight and not soft and supple, I’m starting to wonder if more showers were bad, even though they felt good for my muscles. This is deff an odd and super paranoid question for me to have, but thanks for reading!","I’m not a doctor obviously, but I can’t imagine it would be that bad for you.

51,"my best friend is having issues with his borderline-abusive stepdad, what resources are available to help?",58," 

Firstly,  we're both minors in AZ. He's always had issues with his stepfather,  I've seen it and experienced it first-hand (not relevant; too long for  this post anyway) We'll call the stepdad Carl.

Carl  is always on-edge whenever I see him, it seems like one little thing,  say, leaving something on the unused motorcycle, is enough to tip him  off in a fit of internal rage. On top of this, he is incessantly calling  my friend a failure to him and to his family, to the point where he  believes it too. I can't really emphasize this enough. My friend is  diagnosed ADHD but they refuse to treat it, and part of ADHD is sensitivity to rejection and failure. He seems to have the failure  sensitivity, and as such, waves of depression and self-harm effectively  take over his entire mind for days (usually the cutting stops the  sadness for him.)

At  this point he's conflicted. His dad lives in florida, and he'll be  going there for summer. Of course, he wants to see his dad, but half the  argument for going to FL is entirely getting away from his hostile  household. I want to help him, and I know one phone call can get Carl  out of his life, but I don't want that. It would be detrimental to the  him, his sister, and his mom since Carl is the main source of income for  that household.

What  can I do? What resources are available for me to help? I'm willing to  say more, because I'm always forgetting something, just ask.","It definitely is emotional abuse. As far as resources go in Arizona (I’m also in Arizona with the same issue) I couldn’t find any besides the typical therapist. As far as the cutting goes, he should definitely seek help for that. I went through the same thing and still struggle with it. 

As far as things you can do for him, be there for him, check up on him. It may not seem like much but it definitely helps in the grand scheme of things."
52,How do I take action in my life when I feel like there is no where to turn?,33,"
Hey all, I came here to vent because I’ve just never felt this way before. It may come down to the fact that I’m just a spoiled college student. 

Let me just go into this by saying, I’m a 20 y/o guy who just scraped by his sophomore year of college after dropping a class before the beginning of second semester and 3 at the end in order to save my gpa. 

I feel like a failure after this year, I’m reminded constantly by all my friends who are doing incredibly in their lives. Today was a ton of bricks to the face however, I woke up at 1 after sleeping through 2 alarms (I still live with my parents) my mother, who I made plans for lunch with began to lecture me on my responsibilities as a 20 year old and how I should be more productive with my life though I do have a job with good pay but I know her points mainly stem from the dropped classes of the semester prior and my terrible sleep schedule.

 I’ve felt like a failure and waste of skin and am being reminded left and right by family and my girlfriend (she’s fulfilling her dream to become a nurse and I couldn’t be more proud of her). 

I really don’t know what to do, even though I’ve been trying very hard to create a routine for myself it seems I’m still fucking up and can’t do anything right. 

I was told today that I only make excuse after excuse and that I’m being nothing but showing myself pity. I’ve tried to be true and just when telling people my motives or life circumstances but as of now I don’t know what I really believe I’m doing or if what I’m doing is acceptable.

I truly need help figuring myself out because I feel I’m taking 2 steps backwards every time I think I’m taking a step forward and I feel as if my life is crumbling to the ground. 

Thank you to anyone whose taken the time to read my sob story and no matter what your advice is I truly appreciate it.",sometimes taking a few steps backward will take you forward on a path you didnt realize before
53,Girlfriend’s Mom is a Bit Crazy,223,"As the title states, my girlfriend’s mom is at the minimum - overreaching, clingy, untruthful, and downright invading. 

This has been going on for a while, but my girlfriend’s mom frequently comes to her apartment and spies on her when she thinks my girlfriend isn’t paying attention. This consists of using her gate code to access the gated complex, driving into a space, and watching to see what she’s doing. My girlfriend and I imagine that it is because she doesn’t like me and her together and me as a person to be completely honest. So she sits in the parking lot to see if she can see my car and/or if I happen to exit the house or anything. 

My girlfriend claims they have had a decent relationship but now that she’s out of college, her mother overreaches and tries to push herself into my girlfriend’s life. She’s always been aggressively clingy with her and in high school, her mom actually yelled at me for talking to her daughter. She was threatened by me. My girlfriend and I are both 21, happily together. We’ve had some issues in the past which her mother holds onto and uses against our relationship but never is up front about it with my girlfriend. Just makes snide remarks and treats her like she’s in high school with an iron fist of control. My girlfriend wants to talk to her but also doesn’t because her mom makes herself the victim and will cry/become extremely hostile if she is made the “bad guy”. There’s almost zero room for communication.

Also I’m making this post for my girlfriend because she does not have Reddit. 

Any advice? 

TL;DR - girlfriend’s mom is crazy overbearing on her and tends to show up and spy on her at her apartment, need advice for how to handle this situation and situations like it.","Time to set boundaries. Her mother won't like and it's not going to be easy. She needs to have a serious conversation with her mom. In this conversation she will detail that she is an adult and that she no longer needs to be treated like she's in high school. (My step mom  had me call/text eveyday when I got home from school.) Snooping around her appartment is immature. Set ultimatums if you don't follow these rules then I will cut contact with you entirely, or if you are caught snooping around my apartment again. Ensure that her mother knows that establishing boundaries doesn't mean that she doesn't love her any more, it just means that she isn't a child and will not tolerate being treated as such.

Her mom will more than likely blame you or throw a tantrum, but don't back down. Depending on the setting (like having this discussion in your apartment) tell her that if she refuses to be mature that she will have to leave. I would recommend doing this in a public setting that way if she makes a scene you have multiple witnesses also you can just leave if she refuses to see reason.

It's important for your girlfriend to understand that setting boundaries is a healthy practice. She's not a child anymore and if her mother is still trying to control her like this it's unhealthy for BOTH of them. Lots of mom's develope an empty nest syndrome after all of their kids move out. This could be part of why she's behaving this way. Suggest (tactfully) that her mother talk to a therapist.

If she refuses to cooaperate with this at all, then it's time to cut contact. You might cut contact for a month or two, but it could be longer. Again it's not that your girlfriend doesn't love her mother, it's that her mother's behavior is having a negative or toxic effect on her. It's okay to cut people out of your life who are toxic."

55,What sport do I choose?,5,"So next year will be my second to last year of High School (Junior year) and I wanted to do a sport and I've decided on two.  Either soccer or wrestling.  On one hand I played soccer for my entire childhood until 8th grade when a time conflict made me stop.  I loved to play and push myself but I never pursued playing for better teams so I plateaued for the last 3 years (I know this is a brag but I was always commended as the best on the team - scoring a quarter of our goals in a couple seasons (even though non-competitive league)).  Problem with doing soccer is that I haven't played in 2 years and obviously there will be players with more skill and endurance than me (I tried training this spring for running but only increased mile time by 15 seconds).  As for wrestling, it would be something new and I have little reason to believe that I would be turned away.  I feel like it's something I could actually see myself trying in so I'm definitely tempted.  Also I feel like doing wrestling could entice me to actually work out more (at all).  

Essentially: Soccer vs. wrestling
Soccer pros: something I used to (and probably still) would love.
Soccer cons: completely out classed by many others most likely
Wrestling pros: meeting new people, getting better body(?), trying something new
Wrestling cons: I've never done it and don't know anything about it

Sorry if this was really unorganized but I appreciate any and all comments.","Personally I’d say soccer. It seems like such a cool thing to be a part of. Idk how other schools are, but at my school the wrestling team had negative connotations (probably because almost all the wrestlers had ringworm and would also harass girls). That being said, the choice is yours in the end, and I’m sure your heart knows what it wants best :)"
56,Approaching Businesses to Introduce Product,2,"Hey guys! So I'm 21 this year and looking to approach businesses (eateries) to pitch to them a PLA straws. A lil bit of background first. 

&#x200B;

I live in Malaysia, and starting June 1st, the 2 main states here are banning plastic straws. Honestly a move that I've been waiting for so long. I've been quite environmentally conscious most of my life and this has presented not such a unique opportunity to me, but a good one. Since around a year ago, I've been quite involved in environmental movements, rallies, trash cleanups and so on. I've always been looking for business opportunities to put myself into but this is one that I'm extremely passionate about. My state deciding to ban plastic straws has created a demand for alternatives. I mean, people need something to use to sip on their drinks. After about 5 minutes of searching Google, I found PLA straws. It's not a completely new product and it's been around for a while. Anyways after going through any laws that my country has that might prevent me from bringing this product in, it seems that there are none. 

&#x200B;

I need advice on how I should go about approaching these businesses and what's the best way to pitch them this product. 

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance everyone!

57,Part time jobs for someone with anxiety,12,"I'm 19, sophomore in college studying psychology, and I need to get myself a part time job for gas, spending money, textbooks, and repaying my student loans.

When I was 16 I worked at an IHOP (pancake house for non-Americans), and then at 17 I worked at a Subway (sandwich shop). The work itself wasn't hard but I would get pretty decent anxiety attacks whenever I would think about the job and in the hours leading up to my shifts.

I want a job that I can maintain until I'm done with my undergrad degree, but I don't know what would work best for me, so I turn to you, Reddit. Any advice? 

Note: I've had family and friends tell me to do something that involves my hobbies or my major so that it doesn't feel like work. But in my town there aren't many reliable options. Also, I've heard that I should get a job that scares me so that I overcome my anxiety but idk.

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.","have you looked into telemarketing jobs? they usually hire quite frequently. also, my dad used to work on a farm and he loved it since he got to work with animals all day. i know in my city you can work for the summer at the local strawberry field and pick berries all day."

Not on the level of a client's vulnerability, but still quite vulnerable. Like it takes guts to do that stuff. It is vulnerable."
62,So I did have a session with two therapists. Therapy update.,28,"My therapist texted that he would just introduce me to Dan, my new therapist. But it turns out that he was also going to sit in our session too.

Dan just sat at the sofa at the side and took notes. My old T and I talked about our past sessions and recaped what we worked on and what needs to be worked on. Dan reacted occassionally especially to all the crazy things that my family and past psychiatrist had done.

Examples would be: My mom tying me to the chair with phone charger cables when she found out about my self harm. My psychiatrist telling that I was cutting for attention. My family telling me to think happy thoughts to cure my depression

There was even a moment my old T had to signal a time out because I told Dan about how my old psychiatrist said that I could talk to depressed people because I couldn't get more depressed than I already am and he was like, ""Woooah there... Wtf...""

Dan seemed like a really nice guy. He told me that he used to self harm in 3rd-4th year of college then stopped. He likes working with clients who sh. He has a goatee and a tattoo of a cross on his left inner arm. He seems more chill and casual than my old T.

It was fun to watch my old T and Dan interact like they were good friends. Even the receptionist (who is taking masters in psychotherapy) asked what I thought of Dan.

My old T said that Dan was excited to work with me. Dan heard about my case a year ago because they're a group practice. I'm excited to work with him too. He's easy to talk to. Very genuine especially with his reactions because I'm used to therapists having very controlled emotions.

That's it. I'm officially seeing Dan, my new therapist, next Thursday. Scary but exciting.",I’m glad to hear that things are going well in the co-counselor situation and that the new one seems like a good fit!
63,Fucked up from my therapist’s countertransference - can anyone relate?,16,"I was seeing a therapist for the last 6+ years.  I got sober 6-8mos in.  Now I’m 5.5yrs sober and doing really well.  

He helped me massively but in the last 6 months I was not receptive to the work we were doing.  The way we were doing things just stopped working for me and i was hitting a wall.  He truly believes his way is the only way, which i believed for awhile so i kept going.

When I voiced the fact that this modality or therapeutic relationship wasn’t working, he basically doubled down on his way being the only way and I felt like he was saying something was wrong with ME that it wasn’t working- that is how I took it, it may not have been his intention.  He was also anti - medication, I am bipolar and see a psychiatrist regularly and am well regulated.  He was encouraging me to stop taking the medication (he is not a psychiatrist by the way), which I told him was a deal breaker for me.  This started the initial rift a few months ago.

I needed a real hard ass when I first got sober who wouldn’t let me get away with my BS.  But once I got to a really good consistent place, he was still treating me the same way and being harsh and stern, and when I called him out, he basically didn’t see the problem.  He didn’t see why the person i am now may need something different than the person i was 6 years ago.  He was also telling me it would be mistake to stop working with him and most other therapists suck.  Edited to say: he’s been seeing some patients for 30 years, he consistently said we needed to work together for years to work through everything. 

When I made amends to him in our last session, it was pretty fucked up and he was talking over me, and said “you haven’t been harming me, these (things you’re making an amends for) are just the THINGS THAT YOU DO.”  I’m cutting down all the details since this is fucking long, but he was really harsh and argumentative - when I was just trying to apologize for paying late in the past and having a shitty attitude towards him, an apology I think he was owed.

Now I’m mad I didn’t leave earlier and I’m questioning how much of the treatment was actually valid?  My psychiatrist said this person clearly formed some unhealthy attachment to me.  

I’m just fucking mad that I paid person so long and wish i had left earlier.  I felt like he needed me to be broken, and was gaslighting me to keep stringing me along.  Thing is - he gave me a massively discounted rate, so he made less off of me than any other patient.  So I feel like it’s not about money.

If you’ve experienced countertransference before or an unhealthy relationship with a therapist - how did you get over that experience??  I’m fucking pissed and feel fucked up about it.",You are describing lots of projections and transference feelings. I'm not sure what are you referring to as counter-transference?
64,I wrote my T this letter but I’m too embarrassed to show it to her. Should I? Or should I listen to my gut and just destroy my whole phone at this point?,21,"I’m sorry I was mean to you the past two weeks.

I don’t *really* hate counselling.

Well, yes I do.

But it’s more complicated than that.

I think I was just angry at it. And by extension, you.

I don’t know why you thought I don’t think this has been beneficial to me. I think it’s been very beneficial. I’m a lot better than I was in February, and I started seeing you in February, too.

I know they always say correlation does not equal causation, but COME ON. Coming here has to be why I got better. That’s why I keep coming back.

You probably just thought I didn’t think it was helping since I always talk about how much I hate it here.

...Which is fair.

The point is, for a while everything was going great. I was making progress and getting better.

Then I went home.

I know I said I don’t know what I want to get out of this. 

But that was a lie.

I just didn’t want to tell you.

Before I started coming here I read on the internet that therapy is supposed to be a “healthy model of behaviour”.

It said that counsellors are aware of all the things you do that are off-putting to others and help you change them so you can have better relationships.

So I figured, if you liked me, everyone would.

And you said you liked me.

So I believed you.

But then I went home, and nothing changed.

My parents still didn’t love me.

It’s confusing because the things you said *helped*. My friendships got better. My life got better. I even felt a little bit better about myself.

(Just a little bit, though. Don’t get too excited.)

And the first time I went home, when you told me I couldn’t just keep doing things the way I had been and that I had to talk to my parents and aunts and uncles about how they were treating the kids, I did. 

And then that got better, too. 

I mean, it’s still kind of a mess there. But not reportable anymore, I think.

So... I thought it was working.

I trusted you.

Kind of.

...Enough.

(Don’t get too excited about that, either.)

So when I went home again, and still got treated the same as I always did, all the things you said got in my head.

First of all, it hurt my feelings more than usual when they treated me the way they always have. Because all of a sudden I had someone treating me nicer than that and now I wasn’t used to them anymore.

That was the first thing you did that felt like a lie.

Why were you nice to me?

You weren’t a “healthy model” at all! 

The real world is still just as shitty as it always was, but now I’m even *more* sensitive to it, which I didn’t think was even possible. 

That didn’t feel like getting better.

But I still trusted you. 

I thought, maybe if I just stand up for myself the way I stood up for my siblings and cousins, things will get better for me, too.

But then that didn’t go the way I wanted it to.

I was gonna text you again after that and ask for help. 

But when I checked my phone I saw it had been almost a week since I texted you about scheduling another appointment and you hadn’t responded, so I didn’t think you would respond to my little crisis, either.

I figured you weren’t ignoring me on purpose.

This isn’t the first time you’ve taken a while to respond, so I know that’s just how you are. Plus your emails have been getting sent progressively later, too, so I’m guessing you just have a lot going on lately.

That’s fine.

I have a lot going on lately, too. I hope you’re ok.

And I don’t really care if you take a while to respond.

But it reminded me that I can’t rely on you.

I don’t even know you!

I didn’t know why you weren’t responding. And I never know how long you’ll take to respond or when our next appointment will be or how long you’ll be there for before I’m on my own again.

When I saw you didn’t respond, it hit me that I had no way of knowing if I’d ever see you again.

Maybe you got burnt out or someone died or something else happened and you decided to stop being a counsellor and I needed to stop using you as a crutch and solve my own problems for once.

Maybe I already was on my own again, and just hadn’t figured it out yet.

How am I supposed to keep coming back here if I don’t even know when it’s gonna be over? But you won’t tell me how long I need to be here for.

I can’t rely on that!

And I felt like an idiot for ever wanting to.

That’s not even what you’re for!

You’re supposed to teach me how to be more independent, I thought. And better at functioning by myself. Except then when I got there you did the opposite.

So I figured I was wrong, and I trusted you instead.

I tried to do things your way.

I tried to do everything you said.

I thought it would make things better.

But I just got even more hurt because of it.

And then when I had no one, again, it suddenly felt like I had lost something.

That made me feel even worse than I did before I ever tried, when I felt like I’d never had anyone at all.

And I wished I’d never come here in the first place.

But then later you responded to my text and said it was an accident and I didn’t know how to tell you that I changed my mind about booking another appointment and that I never wanted to come back.

So I came back.

But I didn’t trust you anymore.

I couldn’t figure out why our next appointment didn’t feel the same. I thought it was you.

I even booked appointments with other counsellors. But they didn’t feel the same, either. They didn’t even feel like Christina, my second-favourite counsellor. 

They felt more like Dr. Fisher.

That’s when I realized that I was the problem.

I was acting like how I did with Dr. Fisher. And I didn’t trust her *at all*. But you aren’t like her. You never say mean things, even though I always think you will.

So, I’m really sorry for behaving the way I did. You didn’t do anything to be treated like that. You did everything right. 

I just couldn’t handle all my feelings, and I guess I took it out on you before I realized what I was doing.

You already said I don’t have to care about hurting your feelings. So don’t worry, I know that. 

I don’t care about your feelings.

But it wasn’t fair for me to be mean to you, and I hate when things aren’t fair. So, I just wanted to say sorry for my own sake.

So... 

Sorry.

PS: I’m going home again this weekend. So... sorry in advance for that, too.

PPS: I’m also sorry for leaving my wallet in your office last session. I have never felt the Walk of Shame more palpably than walking back to your office immediately after leaving to get it. I think I’m more sorry to myself than to you for that one, actually. But, still. Thanks for not making me wait a whole week.","I think your gut is telling you to destroy this because it's very vulnerable and real. That's hard to do when you grew up in a fucked-up family.

If you can bear the embarrassment and share these words with your therapist, it might help you guys to connect just a little more securely. Incremental progress is always something to be proud of."
65,Therapist’s political/social views differing from your own,7,"So, I just found out that my therapist has pretty different views on gender than I do. I’m not sure what to do about it.

For reference, I’m a cis bisexual woman, and I’m involved in some LGBT activism at my university. It’s something that’s important to me, and through this I’ve become friends with some trans people, all of whom I care about and have a great amount of respect for.

I brought up one of my friends (who happens to be a trans woman) from an LGBT group I’m involved in in therapy last session. My therapist didn’t take it too well. He seemed somewhat feminist-y prior to this, but after I mentioned my friend he told me that 1. he doesn’t believe people can be trans/non-binary and 2. he believes there is an inherent difference between men and women (gender-wise, not sex-wise). These views are completely the opposite from my own.

My problem now is I really don’t know how to proceed. My therapist has been incredibly important to me up until now, but knowing this about him changes my views on him a lot. I don’t expect (nor want) to be able to change his mind, but I just feel kind of crushed by this. I’m not really looking for an argument on who’s in the right here in terms of our views. I guess I’m just wondering what someone should do in this situation? Like, what do you do if your therapist has been incredibly helpful, but you find out their views differ drastically from yours? Especially if it’s in a way that you feel could impact your relationship.",Did you ask him directly his opinion? Or did he offer it?
66,Why would i crave to know that my therapist is thinking of me outside session?,9,And why would i find it hard to believe even though he's made clear he does?,"I think about my therapist a lot. She is a person I care about, who cares about me and who I place a lot of trust in, so I want to think that she thinks about me a lot, that I am of a similar level of importance even though I know I wont and cant be. Maybe it's the same for you?"
67,Feeling like it’s time for me to bring up transference after our convo yesterday. Terrified of what will happen to the relationship.,6,"Hi all. I am a massive over thinker and I’m just looking for some help as to what to expect if I open up to my therapist about the romantic/sexual feelings I’ve experienced for him.

I’ve been in therapy with this therapy for 2.5 years (I’m 23f). We have strong rapport and while I feel like we both seem to be drawn to each other, my therapist has always kept it professional. No touching, no trying to interact outside the office, doesn’t say anything inappropriate etc. But once in a while I do get a “vibe” from him that he is attracted to me in some way (not even necessarily physically) that is noticeable even separate from my own feelings. This scares me because I worry that if I tell my therapist that I have strong feelings towards him and have for a long time (I think he knows anyways), that his own feelings may be triggered and he may feel the need to end our relationship. I am currently out of the country for over a year, so we do teletherapy and it would be difficult for me to find another therapist right now and to start with a blank slate all over again.

I have tried to avoid my transference for a long time because I don’t want to risk losing this therapy that helps me so much, but now I’m scared that by not saying anything I may hurt it too. Sometimes I think maybe I do just need a new therapist altogether but our work has been so infinitely helpful and my therapist is so much more capable than any other I’ve had over the last 8 years, that I hate the thought of switching it up all over again. 


Anyways, yesterday I was talking to my therapist about my obsessive fear of doing the right versus the wrong thing and how I can’t enjoy my life because I’m always analyzing if it’s ok to make any decision or not. He was saying how we can’t really know if something is right or wrong, and I mentioned that last year when I told him I was marrying a guy I’d known for less than a year and moving out of the country, his response was “Jesus Christ.” Which definitely made me feel that I was doing the wrong thing. 

He replied by apologizing for saying that. He said it was grandiose of him to say something like that. Then he said the reaction was not because he thought I was doing the wrong thing but because he let personal issues surface and that he’s really sorry. He said that he really values our relationship and he figured that was going to be the end of it and he would miss me, and that’s why he reacted in such a way. After clarifying this he continued on to address the issue of my moral obsessing. 

This conversation yesterday left me with really mixed feelings. On one hand, it’s nice to have a therapist who supports me and truly cares for me despite having seen me act my absolute worst. On the other, it’s terrifying hearing that he cares because what if he cares too much, and he ends our relationship over it? What if either of our emotions could hurt the therapy? What if I tell him about my feelings and he self-discloses too much about the way he’s felt about me and it hurts the therapeutic process? I feel sick over this, and now I feel like I should just talk about my feelings for him out in the open so that he can help me calm down about my therapy concerns. But I’m scared of the consequences of acknowledging my feelings, too. I try very hard to be my honest self in therapy and not let my feelings for him get in the way of the goal, I don’t let my feelings hold me back from telling him any shitty stuff about me, but I worry that all these thoughts I have about him regularly are dominating my life too much and will affect my progress. For this reason, I do feel like I need to talk about my transference, but there are so many fearful “what if’s” holding me back. 

Any advice with navigating these feelings and a discussion with my therapist is greatly appreciated.","It can go so many different ways but it’s ultimately going to be up to you to take the risk or not. I was in a similar situation and for me it came to the point where i didn’t have much to say other than this next thing which was my attraction. So I think you’ll know - if you can still work on other therapy things maybe hold off but if it becomes all consuming bring it up? 

Good luck!"
68,Someone identified me based on this subreddit,35,"which is absolutely WILD. Basically it came out in a non-HIPAA violating way that one of my therapist’s other clients realized based on my posts that we share a therapist, and then in a group situation they realized that specifically, it was me. 

I feel guilty even posting about it? Because obviously she is going to read it (hi - if you want to talk we can but if that’s too weird that’s okay too? I don’t think there’s any like, guidelines on how to navigate this situation lmao. and if you want me to delete this, I can do that too). But also I’ve been freaking out about it and I don’t want to feel like I no longer have a right to this space. 

I’m having a lot of feelings about it...on one hand it’s outrageously funny that this situation is even happening. It’s neat that I have this in common with someone. It’s like...really intimate? But also I do not know her at all, and she knows me, which is an interesting situation to be in. And of course I’m panicking because I know it came up in individual therapy for her, and now I don’t know if my therapist knows more about me than I’ve told him.

Also having some big angry feelings towards my therapist for not like, protecting me. He knew I was the person she was talking about. Obviously he couldn’t say anything - that wouldn’t be fair to her, it would be, y’know, illegal, I don’t WANT him to break confidentiality because then that could mean he would break it about me, etc etc etc but also fuck!!!! To some extent, I feel violated and it’s much easier to just be pissed off at my therapist than at this other client because really, if the situation was reversed, I wouldn’t have done anything differently.","OMG wow.

Hi everyone!

I'm doing my dissertation at the moment on the link between mental health and group membership and would be so grateful if you could complete my questionnaire which should take you less than 20 minutes. At the end you will have the option to enter a prize draw for 3 chances of a £25 cash prize! 

I'm really interested in linking mental health to group membership and trying to use the results to help better the ways in which we help people struggling with their mental health, all of you responses are anonymous and cannot be linked to you. 

Please feel free message me with any questions!"

Hey guys!! Final push! I need some more **FEMALE PARTICIPANTS (18+ y/o)** to take part in my online study. 

The study exploring the attitudes and behaviours of females, following exposure to soft-core pornography (not to worry though, everything shown is legal and obtained from R-Rated commercial US films).

It permeates everything from religious superiority and being one of the chosen to Ariana Grande's latest single to modern politics that demonstrate, apparently, that the people we respect the most (or at least vote for and follow on social media) are the most arrogant and least thoughtful among us. Whatever *we think* is superior to the extreme, anyone who disagrees is ignorant to the extreme. But despite seeing it all around us, we are sure that we ourselves are generally wise and worthy.

What bothers me is how extensively we promote and ensure the continued entrenchment of these tendencies. American politicians and educational institutions, the spearheads of our thought as a society, teach us to memorize facts and indoctrinate opinions, they produce conformity but they don't produce people skilled in objectivity and critical thought. 

Everybody learns critical thinking for problem solving without every learning to apply it for self-examination. On the other side of the same scale we see depression, self-loathing and self-deprecation masquerading as self-examination, to the point where arrogance is the preferred trait. Mental health is ignored. We live in a sick world overflowing with distorted views and allegiances and instead of addressing that problem, our agenda is to steer those distortions in our favor.
